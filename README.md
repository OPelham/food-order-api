# 🍔 Food Order API

A modern, modular Fastify API built for managing food ordering workflows.  
Includes strong type-safe schema validation, centralized logging, health checks, and structured architecture using the Dependency Inversion principle.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔥 Fastify v5 with modular plugin structure
- ✅ JSON Schema-based validation via `ajv-oai`
- 🧪 Testing with `tap` and coverage via `c8`
- 📦 PostgreSQL support via `pg`
- 🪵 Logging via `pino` and `pino-pretty`
- 🧱 Domain-first architecture (Domain → Service → Controller)
- 🧼 Pre-commit checks with Husky, Lint-Staged, ESLint, and Prettier
- 🩺 Health check endpoint with `fastify-healthcheck`

[//]: # (TODO review this)

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 18
- PostgreSQL
- `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (see `.env.example` or setup instructions below)

[//]: # (TODO check env variable setup)

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```



### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create a .env file or export variables manually: 

[//]: # (TODO review this )

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/yourdb
ENVIRONMENT=local
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### 3. Create Schema

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

### Run unit tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Watch mode

```bash
npm run test:watch
```
Coverage thresholds are defined under c8 in package.json.

---

## 🧼 Linting and Formatting

### Run linter

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Auto-fix lint errors:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

---

## Git hooks
This project uses Husky for Git hooks.

### Pre-commit checks

- lint-staged to run "eslint --fix" on staged files
- This is triggered automatically when committing 
- See .husky/pre-commit

### Pre-push checks

- Runs "npm run test" prior to push
- This is triggered automatically when pushing
- See .husky/pre-commit

To skip verification use the "--no-verify" flag
```bash
git push --no-verify
```

### Setup (if needed)
```bash
npx husky init
```

---

## 📐 Generate API Schema

To generate schema from OpenAPI spec or similar source:

```bash
npm run generate:schema
```

The logic for this is in scripts/generate-schema.js.

```

## 🩺 Health Check

The API exposes a health check endpoint:

```text
GET /<app-name>/api/<version>/health/check
```

Useful for container orchestration platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

---

## 🧱 Architectural Overview

This project adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, organizing code using concepts inspired by Onion 
Architecture, with clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers.

- Controllers receive requests and delegate to services
- Services perform logic and use repositories
- Repositories interact with the database
- Domain encapsulates business rules and entities
- Everything is injected via factory functions for testability.
