[![Fastify](https://img.shields.io/badge/fastify-v5-blue)](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)
![Node.js LTS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-22.x%20-339933?logo=node.js&logoColor=white)


A modern, modular Fastify API built for managing food ordering workflows.  
Includes strong type-safe schema validation, centralized logging, health checks, and structured architecture using the Dependency Inversion principle.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 Fastify v5 with modular plugin structure
- ✅ JSON Schema-based validation via `ajv-oai`
- 🧪 Testing with `tap` and coverage via `c8`
- 📦 PostgreSQL support via `pg`
- 🪵 Logging via `pino` and `pino-pretty`
- 🧱 Domain-first architecture (Domain → Service → Controller)
- 🧼 Pre-commit checks with Husky, Lint-Staged, ESLint, and Prettier
- 🩺 Health check endpoint with `fastify-healthcheck`

[//]: # (TODO review this)

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 18
- PostgreSQL
- `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (see `.env.example` or setup instructions below)

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Local Environment Variables

Create a .env file using .env.example or export variables manually: 

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@localhost:5432/testdb
```

### 3. Run Prepare Script

Runs "husky" command to ensure git hooks are active

```bash
npm run prepare
```

---

## Run Database Locally

The local database is used for local development and for integration tests

Consists of a postgres database built using docker-compose.yml
Volume is initialised with test data via init.sql and includes a persistent volume

### Start database

```bash
npm run db:up
```

### Stop database

```bash
npm run db:down
```

### docker-compose CLI

Run in detached mode:
```docker compose up -d postgres```

List volumes:
```docker volume ls```

Inspect volume:
```docker volume inspect food-order-api_postgres-data```

Stop database:
```docker compose down```

Stop database and remove volume:
```docker compose down --volumes```

### psql CLI

Access database via terminal:
```psql -h localhost -U testuser -d testdb```

---

## Running APP and Database with docker compose

### Run server + database
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

```bash
docker compose up --build --detach
```
Call from local via: ```http://localhost:3000```

### Run tests on running container
```bash
docker compose exec api npm test
```

### Start container test, remove container (for CI)
```bash
docker compose run --rm api npm test
```

for CI (removes after run?)

## 🧪 Running Tests

### Run all tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run unit tests

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Report mode 

Applies to unit tests

```bash
npm run test:report
```

### Run integration tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Running an individual test

```bash
tap test/unit/repositories/ingredient-repository.test.js
```

Coverage thresholds are defined under c8 in package.json.

---

## 🧼 Linting and Formatting

### Run linter

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Auto-fix lint errors:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

---

## 🪝 Git hooks
This project uses Husky for Git hooks.

### Pre-commit checks

- uses lint-staged to run "eslint --fix" on staged files
- See .husky/pre-commit

### Pre-push checks

- Runs "npm run test" prior to push
- See .husky/pre-commit

To skip verification use the "--no-verify" flag
```bash
git push --no-verify
```

### Setup (if required)
```bash
npx husky init
```

---

## 📐 Generate API Schema

To re-generate schema from OpenAPI spec:

```bash
npm run generate:schema
```

See: scripts/generate-schema.js.

---

## 🚀 Run Server

### Start server in production mode
- log level info
- log redaction active
- structured logs

```bash
npm run start
```
### Start server in local mode
- log level debug
- log redaction off
- pino-pretty logs
- run with nodemon

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

---

## 🧪 Continuous Integration (CI)
![CI](https://github.com/OPelham/food-order-api/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/opelham/food-order-api?sort=semver)


This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate linting, security scanning, testing, and Docker image publishing.

### ⚙️ CI Pipeline Overview

The CI pipeline consists of three independent jobs:

| Job                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔍 `scan`          | Runs `npm audit` and [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/codeql-overview) static analysis to detect vulnerabilities and code quality issues. |
| 🧪 `lint-and-test` | Uses Docker Compose to build the API and Postgres service. Then runs `npm run lint` and `npm test`.                                                                                                                                    |
| 🐳 `docker`        | Builds and pushes a Docker image using metadata from `package.json`, the branch name, and the commit SHA. This job only runs on pull requests to `develop`, `release`, or `release/**`.                                                |

### 📦 Branch-Based Behavior

| Event          | Source Branch | Target Branch | Triggered Jobs          |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| `push`         | `feature/**`  | —             | `scan`, `lint-and-test` |
| `pull_request` | `develop`     | `release`     | All                     |
| `pull_request` | `release`     | `main`        | All                     |

> ℹ️ The `docker` job is skipped for pull requests into `feature/**`.

### 🏷️ Docker Image Tag Format

The image is tagged using the format:

```text
<environment>-<version>-<short-sha>
```

For example:
```release-1.0.0-a1b2c3d```

Where:

- **environment** is derived from the target branch (e.g., release, develop, main)
- **version** comes from package.json
- **short-sha** is the first 7 characters of the commit SHA

```

## 🩺 Health Check

The API exposes a health check endpoint:

```text
GET /<app-name>/api/<version>/health/check
```

Useful for container orchestration platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

---

## 🧱 Architectural Overview

This project adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, organizing code using concepts inspired by Clean 
Architecture, with clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers.

- Controllers receive requests and delegate to services
- Services perform logic and use repositories
- Repositories interact with the database
- Domain encapsulates business rules and entities
- Everything is injected via factory functions for testability.
